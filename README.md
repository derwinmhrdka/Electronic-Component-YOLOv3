# Electronic-Component-YOLOv3

## Introduce
This project created to detect, count, and recognize multiple custom object using YOLOv3-Tiny method.
The target object are electronic components that include resistor, diode, capacitor, transformer, and transistor.

Special thanks to nickdademo who made a beautiful GUI that used in this project. Visit nickdademo on https://github.com/nickdademo/qt-opencv-multithreaded

You can watch how to created YOLOv3-Tiny model on my video on:

## Project Information
> Languange: Python
> 
> Library : OpenCV, PyQT, etc.
> 
> Method : YOLOv3-Tiny

## Weights Model and CFG
You can use my trained YOLOv3-Tiny weights and CFG that can be downloaded on
