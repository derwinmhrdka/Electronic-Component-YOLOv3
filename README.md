# Electronic-Component-YOLOv3

## Introduce
This project created to detect, count, and recognize multiple custom object using YOLOv3-Tiny method.
The target object are electronic components that include resistor, diode, capacitor, transformer, and transistor.

Special thanks to nickdademo who made a beautiful GUI that used in this project. Visit nickdademo on https://github.com/nickdademo/qt-opencv-multithreaded

## Weights Model and CFG
You can use my trained YOLOv3-Tiny weights and CFG that can be downloaded on https://drive.google.com/file/d/1PAD2vmwc4glE3-WYmvngHKYrzEgoOZrH/view?usp=sharing
Place entire files on **Files** folder to use weights and cfg files.

### Thank You!
